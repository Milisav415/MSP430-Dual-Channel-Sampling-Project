# MSP430-Dual-Channel-Sampling-Project
This embedded project implements a dual-channel data sampling system using the MSP430 microcontroller. It samples values from two analog channels, processes the data, and transmits it via UART. The system is designed to demonstrate efficient multi-channel sampling, data buffering, and user interaction through button controls and status LEDs.
